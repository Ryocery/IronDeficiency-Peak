# IronDeficiency

A configurable comical mod that causes you to be able to trip at random, and even worse, just completely pass out, even while climbing. The chances of either happening can be configured or you can select one as preference. Due to this mod being purely RNG, it is mostly meant as a way to cause chaos in your lobby.

- Tripping requires you to be grounded and moving.
- Fainting can happen anywhere, even while climbing or standing still. 
  - Although you can disable it for climbing, even though that is the funniest part.

# Installation

Extract the mod folder and put it in `BepInEx/Plugins`. Do note that the .dll file alone is not enough as it relies on a custom sound.

This mod is only **local**, this means that everyone needs to have it installed.

You can modify the faint sound to anything you want as long as you make sure it is called `faint_sound.wav` and the file has a sample rate of 48.000 kHz.
